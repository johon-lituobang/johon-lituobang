### Hi, I studied in Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and I am taking Berkeley courses now. I have started to deposite my works publically in Github since 2022 June 10 for some PNAS papers.

There are six papers and codes deposited here. I introduced them in a time series. 

The first one is "Infer metabolic directions from moment differences of mass-weighted intensity distributions". It proposed a method to infer the metabolic directions by analysing the mass spectra dataset without requiring annotating their structures. 

This work was finished two years ago, and later I shared to some professors. I registered the domain, http://directome.org and http://biomathematics.org in January, 2022. It is prepared for a PNAS brief report but later I realized the mean estimator is critical in this method, so I started to develop robust mean estimators. Therefore this work was posponed to this stage.

The second one is "Matrix dissimilarity from the differences of moments and sparsity". It classified current dissimilarity measures into two groups: mean dissimilarities and sparisity dissimilarities, and proposed a new class of dissimilarity measures call standard deviation dissimilarity. This method can delineate the key factors underlying group differences. For example, in biology, mean dissimilarity indicates differences driven by up/down-regulated gene expressions, standard deviation dissimilarity reflects the heterogeneity of response to treatment, and sparsity dissimilarity corresponds to differences prompted by the activation/silence of genes.

This work was also initiated two years ago, and later I shared to some professors for collaboration. It is also prepared for PNAS. Later I realized the moment estimator is critical in this method, so I started to develop robust moment estimators. Therefore this work was posponed to this stage.

The third one is "

I am introducing this work in YouTube and Quora, if you are interested, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/@Iobiomathematics or https://www.quora.com/profile/Tuobang-Li-1/answers . Also, it has been deposited in Zenodo. Tuobang Li. (2023). Matrix dissimilarities based on differences in moments and sparsity. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10406288 and research gate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377974505_Matrix_dissimilarities_based_on_differences_in_moments_and_sparsity
