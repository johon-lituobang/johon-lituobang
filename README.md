### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I studied in Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and I am taking Berkeley courses now. I have started to deposite my works publically in Github since 2022 June 10 for some PNAS papers.

There are six papers and codes deposited here. I introduced them in a time series. 

The first one is "Infer metabolic directions from moment differences of mass-weighted intensity distributions". It proposed a method to infer the metabolic directions by analysing the mass spectra dataset without requiring annotating their structures. This work was finished two years ago, and later I shared to some professors. I registered the domain, http://directome.org and http://biomathematics.org in January, 2022. 

The second one is

This work was finished two years ago, and later I shared to some professors. I registered the domain, http://directome.org and http://biomathematics.org in January, 2022. It is prepared for PNAS. I am introducing this work in YouTube and Quora, if you are interested, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/@Iobiomathematics or https://www.quora.com/profile/Tuobang-Li-1/answers . Also, it has been deposited in Zenodo, Tuobang Li. (2024). Infer metabolic momentum from moment differences of mass-weighted intensity distributions. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10616979 and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377974502_Infer_metabolic_directions_from_moment_differences_of_mass-weighted_intensity_distributions





This work was initiated two years ago, and later I shared to some professors for collaboration. It is prepared for PNAS.

Also, it has been deposited in Zenodo. Tuobang Li. (2023). Matrix dissimilarities based on differences in moments and sparsity.
